# daily-work-checker
A simple ionic application to do checkin and checkout of your daily work, and calculate how many hours did you work

# How to install?
Clone this repo and run ´npm install´ and ´bower install´ then ´ionic serve´

# How it works?
When you start your work day, go to checkin tab and adjust the date and time (if you do it late) and do a checkin. At the end of the day, go to checkout tab (if the hour differs of your work checkout adjust it) and do a checkout.

In the summary tab you will see how many hours you work in that month

TODO list:

- Finish summary tab
- Test some checkin and checkout 'cheats'
- Browse between months to edit or complete your worked days
